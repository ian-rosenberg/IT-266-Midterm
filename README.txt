Magic is a modification to Quake 4 that does several things:

Ammo no longer exists
Mana replaces the need for ammo
custom gui to present current mana, health, and level
Flashlight has been disabled
level system tied to health and mana

To play, run Quake 4 as normal and boot the mod from the mod menu
Left click to attack and standard WASD-movement controls apply
Certain number of kills are required to level up and increase health as well as mana

To install, compile and copy game86x.dll to game000.pk4
OR copy custom game000.pk4 into mod directory
